"""Cost categories and single ownership.

The highest-priority correctness fix in the design. Insurance, medical, and
vehicle costs each plausibly belong to two calculators, and any overlap
subtracts the same dollar twice — producing a total that is wrong but entirely
plausible on screen.

Every category is owned by exactly one calculator, and the owners together must
partition this enum: total coverage, no overlap. The check runs when the engine
is assembled, so adding a category without an owner fails immediately rather
than silently dropping a cost.

The rule that resolves the hard cases: **a cost belongs to COMMUTE only if it
would fall to zero when `onsite_days_per_week` is zero.** Fuel and tolls vanish;
auto insurance and registration do not, so they are living costs.
