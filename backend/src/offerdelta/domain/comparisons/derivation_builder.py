"""Turning calculated impacts into a derivation tree.

The demo feature: every figure expands into the inputs, formula, and provenance
that produced it.

The tree is built on a first-year basis so every branch shares one period.
Monthly impacts are annualised; one-time impacts stand as they are, because an
event does not recur. Mixing periods would make the parent-equals-children
invariant meaningless, and that invariant is the only thing guaranteeing the
explanation matches the number it explains.

Wealth-only impacts are excluded from a cash tree. The employer match is real
money, but it is not cash, and including it would make the tree disagree with
the total it claims to explain.
