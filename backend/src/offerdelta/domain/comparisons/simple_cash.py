"""The walking skeleton's calculation.

Deliberately the smallest real calculation that produces a derivation tree:
monthly net pay less housing, commute, and living costs. It exists so the
deployed skeleton renders a figure that came from domain code rather than a
literal, which is what makes the deployment worth proving.

Two things replace this shortly:

- Milestone 2 replaces the loose arguments with cost items carrying their own
  category, owning calculator, period, and evidence.
- Milestone 3 replaces the function with the composed calculator engine and the
  full monthly cash-flow reconciliation invariant.

Net pay is taken as given here, which mirrors the phase-1 net-pay override: the
tax engine does not arrive until phase 2.
