"""Turning an inspected preview into an explicit import plan.

Planning is deliberately separate from writing. The preview remains a pure,
read-only description of the source file; only a caller that explicitly asks
for a plan can hand rows to a repository.

The occurrence number solves an important ambiguity in the fingerprint. Two
identical coffees on one day may both be real, so a fingerprint cannot be
unique by itself. Numbering repeats per account preserves both charges while
still making a re-import of the same file a no-op.
