"""Working out which column is which.

Bank exports agree on nothing. The same field is `Description`, `Details`,
`Memo`, `Narrative`, `Payee` or `Transaction`; money out is a negative `Amount`
in one file and a positive `Debit` in the next.

Detection therefore uses two signals and requires both to agree where it can:
the **header name** against a list of aliases, and the **values themselves**. A
column called `date` full of merchant names is not a date column, and a header
guess that the values contradict is dropped rather than trusted.

Uncertainty is reported, never resolved by picking. `detect_mapping` returns
what it found *and* what it could not settle, and the importer refuses to run
until an explicit mapping fills the gaps. A wrong column here corrupts every
figure downstream in a way no later check can catch.
