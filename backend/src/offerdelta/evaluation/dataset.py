"""The labelled evaluation dataset.

The benchmark is only worth the discipline in its schema, and this one carries
four decisions that a looser schema would quietly lose.

**Adjudication is a third field, not an overwrite.** When two annotators
disagree and a human resolves it, both original labels stay. Overwriting the
primary would make inter-annotator agreement unmeasurable afterwards, and
agreement is one of the headline numbers — a benchmark whose own annotators
agreed only 70% of the time has a ceiling that every model score must be read
against.

**Ambiguity is represented, not resolved.** AMAZON is genuinely groceries or
shopping depending on the basket. Forcing one gold label there manufactures
errors that teach nothing about the model, so an ambiguous row carries a set of
acceptable labels and is reported as its own stratum.

**Abstention is separate from error.** A model saying UNKNOWN has not made a
mistake; it has declined to make one. Folding that into the error rate punishes
exactly the behaviour worth rewarding, so it is reported as coverage.

**The dataset is provably frozen.** Comparing three systems on "the same data"
is a claim. The content checksum makes it a fact, and it ignores record order
so two runs over the same rows in a different sequence still agree.
