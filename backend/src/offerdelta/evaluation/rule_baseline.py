"""The rule-based baseline.

This is the number the LLM has to beat, and building it first is the difference
between a result and a press release. "The model scores 0.91" says nothing until
it sits beside a baseline — it might be beating 0.40, or losing to 0.93 at a
hundredth of the cost and latency.

Two design choices matter more than the rules themselves.

**It abstains rather than guesses.** A rule set that guesses on every unseen
merchant would post a higher accuracy and be worse in every way that counts,
because the hybrid routes precisely on abstentions. Guessing destroys the signal.

**It is fitted on the development split only.** Fitting on the holdout would be
the leak the merchant-disjoint split exists to prevent, arriving by a different
door.

The rules are deliberately unsophisticated: remember what each merchant was
labelled, fall back to two weak signals, otherwise say UNKNOWN. That is the
point. A baseline that is clever is a baseline nobody can reason about.
