"""Categorisers and the port they share.

Three systems get compared on one frozen dataset, so all three implement one
interface and the harness cannot accidentally treat them differently.

Every categoriser returns a `Prediction` rather than a bare label, carrying
confidence and a reason. Confidence is what makes the hybrid possible — routing
by it is the whole idea — and the reason is what makes a wrong answer
diagnosable rather than merely wrong.

`Categoriser.name` is recorded in the report. A comparison that cannot say which
system produced which column is not a comparison.
