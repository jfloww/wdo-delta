"""What a system spent producing its answers.

Kept deliberately free of any provider's vocabulary. The report knows about
calls, tokens and latency; it does not know what a model is. A system that has
no cost — the rule baseline — simply reports nothing, and the report says so
rather than printing zeros that look like a measurement.

Cost per transaction sits beside F1 because a system that wins by two points at
forty times the cost has not won, and a report that omits the price cannot say
that.
