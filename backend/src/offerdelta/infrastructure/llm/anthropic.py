"""The Anthropic adapter: a real provider behind the port the harness already uses.

Everything above this file - the categoriser, the hybrid, the metrics, the
report - was written against `LLMProvider` and does not change because this
exists. That was the point of building the port first.

Three decisions are worth stating.

**Structured output through tool use, not prose parsing.** The request pins
`tool_choice` to a single tool whose schema enumerates the valid labels, so a
free-text answer is not one of the shapes the response can take. Parsing prose
for a category means writing a parser for every way a model might phrase
"probably groceries", and being wrong about a case nobody thought of. Making
the API refuse the shape is cheaper and stricter than validating it afterwards.

**Temperature zero.** This is classification, not writing. The same transaction
should get the same label on Tuesday as it did on Monday, or the benchmark is
measuring sampling noise as well as capability. It does not make the model
deterministic - nothing does, across model updates - which is why the model
string and prompt version are recorded with every result.

**The key is never logged, echoed, or repr'd.** It arrives from the environment
and goes into one header. `__repr__` is overridden because a dataclass would
otherwise print it the first time this object appears in a traceback.
