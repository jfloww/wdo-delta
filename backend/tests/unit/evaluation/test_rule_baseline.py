"""The rule-based baseline.

This is the number the LLM has to beat. Without it, "the model scores 0.91" is
not a result — it might be beating 0.40, or losing to 0.93 at a hundredth of the
cost and latency.

The rules are deliberately simple and deliberately abstain. A rule set that
guesses on every merchant it has never seen would score better on accuracy and
be worse in every way that matters, because the hybrid routes on exactly the
abstentions.

Rules are fitted from the development split only. Fitting them on the holdout
would be the leak the merchant-disjoint split exists to prevent, arriving by a
different route.
