"""Cost categories and single ownership.

The correctness fix this taxonomy exists for: insurance, medical, and vehicle
costs each plausibly belong to two calculators. Any overlap double counts real
money, and the resulting error looks entirely plausible on screen.

Every category is therefore owned by exactly one calculator, and the ownership
map must partition the enum — total, with no overlap.
