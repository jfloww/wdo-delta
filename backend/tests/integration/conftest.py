"""Database fixtures.

Every test runs inside a transaction that is rolled back afterwards, so the
suite can point at a real PostgreSQL instance without leaving anything behind.
That matters here: the target is a live Neon database, not a throwaway
container, and a test that litters is a test nobody runs twice.

The whole module skips when CONNECTION_STRING is unset. CI has no secret, and a
suite that fails there for want of one teaches people to ignore red builds.
